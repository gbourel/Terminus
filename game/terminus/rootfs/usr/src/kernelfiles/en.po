"There are a lot of items in the MoreKernelFiles room and one of them contains the sudo password. This password is very powerful password that lets you do absolutely anything in the world. It lets you cast a spell on any item that is protected in any way. You know the password is contained in one of these .txt items. You know that it appears on a line that says the word: 'password='. You should find it with grep's help. Then you'll need to use the sudo spell to find Paradise. To do this, just Type 'sudo' before the command you want to run, like so: 'sudo cp ITEM_A ITEM_B'.

If you open the Certificate in Paradise with sudo, you will have truly found Paradise."
